# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Louise is interested in fundraising money for a future play she would like to create. She is interested in Kickstarter data so she can understand the outcomes of different campaigns based on their launch dates and their funding goals. 
 
### Purpose
The scope of this project is to analyze Kickstarter data for Louise, and provide her with an evaluation of the data so she can understand the most optimal time to launch a campaign and funding goal.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Using the subcategory Play and twelve goal ranges as filters I was able to determine the number of successful, failed, and canceled campaigns. Along with the respective percentages. Plays had the highest rate of success when they had a goal of less than $10,000. Plays with a goal between $45,000 and $49,000 had the highest rate of failure. Followed by Plays with a goal greater than $50,000 and goal between $25,000 and $29,000. Plays had an equal rate of success and failure when their goal was between $15,000 and $19,000. There were no canceled campaigns across any of the goal ranges.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
